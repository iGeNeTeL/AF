## Note
The tool is not 100% perfect, and there might be some occasional bugs.



## Important
The tool is completely safe and does not contain any viruses or anything like that. Although some antivirus programs might give false positives, this occurs because the tool modifies memory values for the game process (to apply the cheats), which may trigger certain antivirus algorithms. 
So I assure you that these warnings are false alarms and do not indicate any actual threat to your system.

This tool is for educational and entertainment purposes only. Use it responsibly and at your own risk.
